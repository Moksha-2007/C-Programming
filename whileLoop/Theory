A while loop in C is a control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified Boolean condition remains true. It is an entry-controlled loop, meaning the condition is evaluated before the loop body is executed in each iteration. 
Syntax
The basic syntax of a while loop is as follows:
while (condition)
{
    // Code to be executed repeatedly
    // Update expression (to eventually make the condition false)
}
while: The keyword that starts the loop.
condition: A logical expression (any non-zero value is considered true, zero is false) that is evaluated before each iteration. The loop continues as long as this condition is true.
Loop Body: The statement or block of statements enclosed in curly braces ({}) that is executed if the condition is true. It is crucial to include a statement within the body that eventually makes the condition false, to prevent an infinite loop. 
How it Works
The execution flow of a while loop is a straight forward process: 
Condition Check: The program first evaluates the condition.
Execution (if True): If the condition is true, the code inside the loop body is executed.
Iteration: After the loop body finishes executing, the control returns to Step 1, and the condition is checked again.
Termination (if False): If the condition is false from the beginning, the loop body is skipped entirely, and program execution continues with the statement immediately following the while loop. 
Example
This example demonstrates how to use a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5:
#include <stdio.h>
int main() 
{
    int i = 1; // Initialization of loop control variable
    while (i <= 5) // Condition check before each iteration
    {
        printf("%d ", i); // Loop body
        i++;             // Update expression (increment i)
    }
    return 0;
}
Output:
1 2 3 4 5
Key Characteristics
Entry-Controlled: The condition is checked at the start, so the loop may execute zero times if the condition is initially false.
Flexible Iteration: It is best used when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a dynamic condition (e.g., reading user input until a specific value is entered).
Potential for infinite loops:If the condition in a while loop never becomes false, the loop will run indefinitely. This can be intentional for tasks like system monitoring (while(1)), but must be handled carefully with a break statement or an appropriate update expression.
