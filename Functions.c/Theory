*FUNCTION;
        A function in C is a self-contained, reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions break down complex programs into smaller, manageable modules, making the code more organized, readable, efficient, and easier to debug. Every C program has at least one function, the main() function, which serves as the program's entry point. 
   *CORE CONCEPTS;
          Using functions in C involves THREE main aspects:
 *PROTOTYPE DECLARATION: This informs the compiler about the function's name, return type, and the number and type of parameters it accepts. It acts as a signature and typically ends with a semicolon.
   *FUNCTION DEFINITION: This contains the actual body of the function, the block of statements that are executed when the function is called.
     *FUNCTION CALL: This is the statement that invokes the function to perform its defined task. When called, program control is transferred to the function's body, and optionally a value is returned to the point of the call. 
	*SYNTAX;
            The basic syntax for a function definition is:

	return_type function_name(parameter_list) 
	{
    		}

   *RETURN TYPE;
            Specifies the data type of the value the function sends back to the caller. It can be any valid data type (e.g., int, float, char) or void if the function does not return a value.
     *FUNCTION NAME;
                A unique identifier for the function.
       *PARAMETER_LIST; 
               A comma-separated list of variables and their types that the function accepts as input (e.g., int a, float b). This list can be empty if no input is needed. 
          *TYPES OF FUNCTIONS;
                      Functions in C are categorized into two main types: 
             *STANDARD LIBRARY FUNCTIONS; 
                       Pre-defined functions provided by the C standard library to perform common tasks. Examples include printf() and scanf() (in <stdio.h>), sqrt() and pow() (in <math.h>), and strlen() (in <string.h>).
      USED-DEFINED FUNCTIONS; 
                Functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks tailored to the program's needs. 
                      USER-DEFINED FUNCTIONS CAN BE FURTHER CLASSIFIED BASED ON WHETHER THEY USE ARGUEMENTS AND RETURN A VALUE; 
     *Takes arguments and returns a value.
	*Takes arguments and returns no value (void).
	  *Takes no arguments and returns a value.
	    *Takes no arguments and returns no value (void). 
     *PARAMETER PASSING;
          Arguments can be passed to functions in two ways: 
       *CALL BY VALUE; 
             A copy of the argument's actual value is passed to the function. Changes made inside the function do not affect the original variable's value outside the function.
         *CALL BY REFERENCE;
             The memory address (reference) of the argument is passed to the function using pointers. This allows the function to directly modify the original variable's value.
