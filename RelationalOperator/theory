Relational operators in C are used to compare two operands and determine the relationship between them. They return a boolean value (1 for true, 0 for false).
The relational operators in C are:
== (Equal to): Checks if two operands are equal.
!= (Not equal to): Checks if two operands are not equal.
> (Greater than): Checks if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
< (Less than): Checks if the left operand is less than the right operand.
>= (Greater than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand. 
<= (Less than or equal to): Checks if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
