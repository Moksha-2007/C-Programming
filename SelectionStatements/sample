Selection statements in C allow a program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a given condition is true or false. The primary selection statements in C are if, if-else, else-if ladder, and switch.
if statement: Executes a block of code only if a specified condition is true.
if-else statement: Executes one block of code if the condition is true, and a different block if the condition is false.
else-if ladder: Allows for multiple conditions to be checked sequentially.
switch statement: Provides a way to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of a single expression.
