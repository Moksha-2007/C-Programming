A do-while loop in C is a control flow statement that executes a block of code at least once before checking a condition. It is known as an exit-controlled or post-tested loop because the condition is evaluated after the code inside the loop has been executed. 
do {
  // Code block to be executed at least once
} while (condition);
How it works
The code block inside the do statement is executed first.
After the code block finishes, the while(condition) statement evaluates the condition.
If the condition is true, the loop repeats, and the code block is executed again.
If the condition is false, the loop terminates, and the program continues with the next statement after the while statement. 
Key characteristics ---
Guaranteed execution: The loop body will always run a minimum of one time, even if the condition is initially false.
Post-test condition: The condition is checked at the end of the loop, which is the primary difference from a while loop, where the condition is checked at the beginning.
