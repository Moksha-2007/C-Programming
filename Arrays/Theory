ARRAYS:
    *An array in C is a collection of elements of the same data type stored in contiguous memory locations. It is a way to store multiple values of the same type under a single variable name. Instead of declaring individual variables for each value, an array allows you to manage and access these values efficiently using an index. Array indices in C start from 0. 
    TYPES OF ARRAYS:
           *Arrays in C are primarily classified based on their dimensionality:

  		*ONE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY(SINGLE-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY):
                         *This is the simplest form of an array, representing a linear list of elements.
                           *Elements are accessed using a single index.

          DECLARATION SYNTAX:
                    dataType arrayName[size];

                 *TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAY(2D ARRAY OR MATRIX):
                      *Can be thought of as an array of arrays, representing data in rows and columns.
                        *Elements are accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column.

           DECLARATION SYNTAX:  
                       dataType arrayName[rows][columns];
